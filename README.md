# ETH Wallet

Despite being one of my most simple contracts, the ETH wallet is one of my favourites and is my go-to got mentorship and demonstrations. It implements deposit, withdrawal, balance checking, and sending - the core features you'd expect from a typical e-wallet.

## Smart Contract Archive

Repositories with the -archive notation are practice projects to demonstrate my ability to write functional Solidity code with real world use cases. I also use these as educational material for some of the peer-to-peer mentorship I do on the side.
